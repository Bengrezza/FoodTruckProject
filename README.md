# Food Truck Project

## Description
Users will input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck.
You will define a FoodTruck class with fields for a unique numeric id, a name ("TacoRific", "Mediterranean Medic", etc.), food type ("Tacos", "Falafel", etc.), and a numeric rating.
You will create a separate class with a main method that starts the program. It will have an array to store up to five FoodTruck objects. The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.
The user is prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks. For each set of input, a FoodTruck object is created, its fields set to the user's input, and it is added to the array. The truck id is not input by the user, but instead assigned automatically in the FoodTruck constructor from a static field that is incremented as each truck is created.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to effectively use and implement Arrays, static data, methods, loops, if statements, Object-Oriented Programming in Java, how to create an Object, implement the toString() method, understand the heap, and use constructors.

## Technologies Used:
